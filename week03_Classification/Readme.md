# MNIST and Classification
This repository contains implementations and experiments using the MNIST dataset, a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is 28x28 pixels, and the corresponding label represents the digit. MNIST is a foundational dataset in machine learning, often referred to as the "Hello World" of the field. It is widely used for testing and developing classification algorithms.

## Contents of This Repository:
Data Preprocessing: Loading and preparing the MNIST dataset for model training.
Classification Models: Implementations using various algorithms, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
  - Neural Networks (MLPs and CNNs)

**Evaluation:** Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

**Advanced Techniques:** Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for improved accuracy.

**Visualization:** Insights into model predictions and feature representations.
