This notes outlines the process of executing an end-to-end machine learning (ML) project based on Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron, enriched with insights from modern ML practices.


# Chapter 3 Classification
This repository contains implementations and experiments using the MNIST dataset, a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is 28x28 pixels, and the corresponding label represents the digit. MNIST is a foundational dataset in machine learning, often referred to as the "Hello World" of the field. It is widely used for testing and developing classification algorithms.


| Chapter 3 Classification | MNIST ~99% Accuracy |
