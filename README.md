This notes outlines the process of executing an end-to-end machine learning (ML) project based on Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron, enriched with insights from modern ML practices.


# [Chapter 3 Classification](https://github.com/Abdalla4AI/Master-ML_DL_GAI_2025/blob/main/week03_Classification/Readme.md)

This repository contains classification algorithms and their implementations, along with experiments using the MNIST dataset. I am exploring how to achieve approximately **99%** accuracy using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9). Each image is 28x28 pixels, and its corresponding label represents the digit. Often referred to as the "Hello World" of machine learning, MNIST is a foundational dataset widely used for testing and developing classification algorithms.

# Chapter 4: Training Models:
In this chapter, We will go deeper into how things work, and understanding what’s under the hood will help us debug issues and perform error analysis more efficiently.

# Chapter 5: Support Vector Machines:
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful and versatile machine learning model used for classification, regression, and outlier detection, handling both linear and nonlinear data. It is especially effective for classifying complex, small to medium-sized datasets. SVMs work by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the feature space, maximizing the margin between the classes. This chapter will explain the fundamental concepts behind SVMs, their practical applications, and how they function, making them an essential tool in machine learning.
