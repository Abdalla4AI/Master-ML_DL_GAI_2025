This notes outlines the process of executing an end-to-end machine learning (ML) project based on Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron, enriched with insights from modern ML practices.


# [Chapter 3 Classification](https://github.com/Abdalla4AI/Master-ML_DL_GAI_2025/blob/main/week03_Classification/Readme.md)

This repository contains classification algorithms and their implementations, along with experiments using the MNIST dataset. I am exploring how to achieve approximately **99%** accuracy using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9). Each image is 28x28 pixels, and its corresponding label represents the digit. Often referred to as the "Hello World" of machine learning, MNIST is a foundational dataset widely used for testing and developing classification algorithms.
